In NUS Fintech Programme, we learned fundamentals of product management and software development. 
As part of the course task, we are divided into groups of 5-7 to build an app in 2 weeks.

Our team decided to build an e-wallet web app called Moolah to let user to top-up, withdraw and transfer money online.


## Objective

- Allow user to top-up balance e-wallet 
- Allow user to withdraw balance from e-wallet
